Project Description
Smoke App is an application made as a social platform for gamers. The name is a play off Steam in regards to minor similarities. Smoke App allows a place for gamers to connect through commenting on games and viewing people with similar interests. The project leverages a third party API called RAWG in order to get details about different games and display them on the site. The landing page will have a list of games. You can click on the desired game and make a comment/reply to someone else's comment.
